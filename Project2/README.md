# Project 2.1: ALU and Regfile

For more details please refer to [course page](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/ca/22s/projects/2.1/).

In this project, you will create an ALU that supports all the operations needed by the instructions in our ISA, and a RegFile which should be able to write to or read from these registers specified in a given RISC-V instruction. 

# Project 2.2: CPU

For more details please refer to [course page](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/ca/22s/projects/2.2/).

In this project you will be using logisim-evolution to implement a 32-bit two-cycle processor based on RISC-V. Once you've completed this project, you'll know essentially everything you need to build a computer from scratch with nothing but transistors.
