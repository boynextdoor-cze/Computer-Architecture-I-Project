Ex 1:
#1
.data: static data
.word: Store listed values as unaligned 32-bit words.
.text: code
#2
output=34, the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence
#3
0x10000010
#4
After entering fib, manually set the value of t3 to 0x0000000D

Ex 2:
k=t0
pointer to source=t1
pointer to dest=t2
loop:
	slli t3, t0, 2
	add t4, t1, t3
	lw t5, 0(t4)
	beq t5, x0, exit
	add t6, t2, t3
	sw t5, 0(t6)
	addi t0, t0, 1
	jal x0, loop
t3=t0*4
t4=t1+t3(source base address + offset)
t6=t2+t3(dest base address + offset)
